% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics

% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in

% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\section{Introduction}
Imagine a robot moving in a typical living room environment which encounters indoor objects such as doors, drawers and chairs etc. We posit that in order for the robot to understand, map or interact with such objects, the robot needs to be able to understand the articulation. Pyschophysical experiments on human motion understanding have demonstrated that human first distinguish between competing motion models (translation, rotation and expansion) and then estimate the motion conditioned on motion model \cite{NIPS2008_3458}.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Historical Perspective}
Using image motion to understand motion and structure in the scene is a historically well studied problem in computer vision.  Ullman \cite{ullman1979interpretation} proposed that in non-degenerate cases under orthographic projection, three pictures of four points can determine structure and motion. Tomasi and Kanade \cite{tomasi1992shape} formalized Ullmans's idea and proposed one of the influential method to compute camera motion and image structure by tracking features in the images. They proposed factorizing a matrix of feature tracks into motion and shape matrix by enforcing the rank constraint of the rigid body motion and metric constraints of a rotation matrix. Costeira and Kanade \cite{costeira1998multibody} extended the factorization idea to segment and recover shape along with motion of multiple moving bodies in the scene. 

Yan and Pollefeys \cite{yan2006automatic} further extended this rank and subspace idea to estimate kinematic chains from tracked features. There are certain fundamental limitations which is common to these approaches. First, the reliance on feature tracking methods such as KLT is not suitable for indoor environments which may not have much texture. Furthermore, this feature tracking requirement limits the application of such methods tremendously by i) Not being able to track new parts/objects that enter/exit the scene, ii) Not modelling the entire scene and as a result not exploring dependencies between neighbouring objects, iii) Restricting the ability to assimilate the motion of objects in SLAM like approaches that map the entire scene. Secondly, motion orthogonal to image plane is not modelled \cite{yan2006automatic} as image projection is modelled as affine projection in the most general case. 

With the discovery of cheap and commonplace hardware such as Kinect, there is a need to re-examine this structure from motion idea. First, since such hardware already provides depth for a feature point, one already has shape as estimated by traditional structure from motion. Also since depth is available, one can model the motion orthogonal to image plane. Texture-less objects can be tracked by adding depth edges to the tracking mix.


\cite{martin2014online} Build on existing work on articulation estimation. Add interactive perception where manipulation adds to perception and vice versa.
  \cite{yan2006automatic} 
    Problem: Analysis and reconstruction of dynamical scenes
    Method: Estimate the rigid motion subspaces. Extend the method to non-rigid
    parts by modeling it with linear combination of key shapes. Use motion
    segmentation ( by SVD) to segment feature trajectories for each object. Use
    n neighbors to estimate local subspace of each point and cluster the
    subspaces to estimate the cluster of trajectories that form the same metric subspace.

\section{Articulation Classification} We consider the problem of motion model identification from point correspondences of motion. In the current work, we consider revolute, prismatic and general motion. Consider motion of two points $x_0,x_1$ (represented in an inertial frame) on a rigid body at time $t_0$ and at some subsequent times $t_1,t_2$. The most general form of rigid body motion of a point can be represented using a rotation matrix $R$ and an associated translation vector $T$
\begin{align}
x_0^{t_1}& = R_{t_0}^{t_1}x_0^{t_0}+T_{t_0}^{t_1}
\end{align}
where the superscript on the point denotes the time.
\subsection{Prismatic}
For points lying on a prismatic joint such as a drawer, rotation w.r.t inertial frame remains the same (R=I), resulting in $x_1^{t_1}-x_0^{t_1} = x_1^{t_0}-x_0^{t_0}$. This is essentially saying that the vector joining two points on a prismatic joint remains the same before and after the motion.
\subsection{Revolute}
For further distinction between revolute and general motion, we need information from more than one time step. For points lying on a body undergoing revolute motion such as a door, the points have same translation vector over time. Hence estimating the translation vector from two time steps $T_{t_0}^{t_1} = T_{t_1}^{t_2}$ is a sufficient condition to classify a joint as revolute joint. 
\subsection{Plane Constrained Motion} Plane constrained motion is useful for characterizing motion of objects like chair that can be translated on a plane and rotated about the normal to the plane. Let the plane be denoted by an point $x_p$ lying on the plane and $\hat{n}$ being normal to that plane. Consider the case of a rigid body that has point $x_c^{t_0}$ in contact with the ground plane which after undergoing the motion moves to $x_c^{t_1}$. Since $x_c^{t_0}$ and $x_c^{t_1}$ both lie on the ground plane, we have
\begin{align}
(x_c^{t_0}-x_0)^T\hat{n}&=0\\
(x_c^{t_1}-x_0)^T\hat{n}&=0\\
x_c^{t_1} &= R_{t_0}^{t_1}x_c^{t_0}+T_{t_0}^{t_1}
\end{align}
By doing algebraic manipulation we get, $(R_{t_0}^{t_1}x_0+T-x_0)^T\hat{n}=0$

\subsection{General Rigid Body Motion}
For general motion such as a book that can be rotated and translated anywhere in the space both the rotation and translation matrix will be different. 
\section{Scene Understanding}
Analysis by method such as ours is essential in order to decompose the scene into types of motion that a robot can influence on the scene.
For example: Understanding the way a drawer can be opened, fridge door can be opened, what can be moved around in the scene

\section{Factorization Approach} In this section, we extend the factorization approach as described in \cite{costeira1998multibody} to 3-D track data available from a depth camera. Assuming for now that a single object moves relative to a static camera and we track features from frame to frame. Following the notation in the paper, lets represent a point on the object as $p_i^T = [X_i,Y_i,Z_i]^T$ in the camera frame, in the current frame $f$, the position of the point in homogeneous coordinates can be represented as 
\begin{align}
s_{fi}^C = \begin{bmatrix} 
p_{fi}^C\\1
\end{bmatrix}
&=\begin{bmatrix}
R_f & t_f\\
0_{1\times3}& 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
p_i\\
1
\end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix}
R_f & t_f\\
0_{1\times3}& 1
\end{bmatrix}
s_i
\end{align}
where $R_f$ and $t_f$ are the rotation and translation of the object from current frame w.r.t to the frame in which object points are initially represented. Assuming that we track $N$ features over $F$ frames, one can write 
\begin{align}
\begin{bmatrix}
u_{11} & ... & u_{1N} \\ 
. &  & .\\
u_{F1} & ... & u_{FN} \\ 
v_{11} & ... & v_{1N} \\ 
. &  & .\\
v_{F1} & ... & v_{FN} \\ 
w_{11} & ... & w_{1N} \\ 
. &  & .\\
w_{F1} & ... & w_{FN} \\ 
\end{bmatrix} & = 
\begin{bmatrix}
i_1^T & | & t_{x_1}\\
. & | & .\\
i_F^T & | & t_{x_F}\\
j_1^T & | & t_{y_1}\\
. & | & .\\
j_F^T & | & t_{y_F}\\
k_1^T & | & t_{z_1}\\
. & | & .\\
k_F^T & | & t_{z_F}\\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
s_1 & . & . &. & s_N
\end{bmatrix}\label{eq:global_motion}
\end{align}
where $(u_{fi},v_{fi},w_{fi})$ is the location of feature point in current frame, vectors $i_f^T,j_f^T,k_f^T$ are the rows of the rotation matrix $R_f$ and $(t_{x_f},t_{y_f},t_{z_f})$ represent the components of the translation vector at time instant with frame $f$. Equation \ref{eq:global_motion} can be represented in a accumulated form as 
\begin{align}
\mathbf{W} & = \mathbf{M}\mathbf{S}
\end{align}
where $\mathbf{W}$ represents the accumulation from trajectories of $N$ points tracked over $F$ frames, $\mathbf{M}$ contains all the information about the motion of the object present in the scene and $\mathbf{S}$ contains all the information about the shape of the object. Since rank of product of two matrices can not exceed the minimum of rank of individual matrics, It is clear that the maximum rank of $W$ is 4. Computing singular value decomposition of $\mathbf{W}$, we get 
\begin{align}
\mathbf{W} = \mathbf{U}\Sigma\mathbf{V}^T \label{eq:motion_factor}
\end{align}
where $U \in R^{3F \times 4}$, and $V \in R^{N \times 4}$ are left and right real singular matrices and $\Sigma$ is a $4\times4$ diagonal matrix of singular values. Although if $\mathbf{W}$ was full rank, we would have to consider $N$ singular values but as the rank of $W$ is 4, we only write out the components corresponding to first $4$ singular values. Writing the factorization as product of two matrices,
\begin{align}
\mathbf{\hat{M}} = \mathbf{U}\Sigma^{\frac{1}{2}}, \mathbf{\hat{S}} = \Sigma^{\frac{1}{2}}\mathbf{V}^T \label{eq:motion_factor}
\end{align}

\subsection{Motion and Shape Estimation} The factorization as defined in Equation \ref{eq:motion_factor} is not unique as any invertible $4 \times 4$ matrix $A$  will lead to an alternate solution $\mathbf{M} = \mathbf{\hat{M}}A$,  $\mathbf{S} = A^{-1}\mathbf{\hat{S}}$
